      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: <strong>March 2026</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-area legal-content">

  <h4>1. Purpose of This Privacy Policy</h4>
  <p>
    The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to clearly explain how Wellworth
    Facilities Pvt Ltd (“Wellworth”, “Company”, “we”, “our”, “us”) collects,
    uses, processes, stores, safeguards, and discloses personal, professional,
    operational, and business-related information. Privacy and data protection
    form an integral part of our governance, compliance, and risk management
    framework across all Services offered by the Company.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wellworth operates in regulated environments involving Facility Management,
    Security Services, Manpower Deployment, and Compliance Support. As a result,
    the handling of personal and operational data is approached with the highest
    standards of confidentiality, integrity, accountability, and lawful
    processing.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Scope and Coverage</h4>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to all individuals and entities interacting with
    Wellworth through its website, digital platforms, physical locations,
    communication channels, contracts, proposals, audits, site operations, and
    workforce deployment activities. This includes clients, prospective clients,
    vendors, consultants, employees, job applicants, security personnel,
    facility staff, and any third parties engaged with the Company.
  </p>

  <p>
    By accessing our website, submitting enquiries, entering into contractual
    relationships, or availing our Services, users acknowledge that they have
    reviewed and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to the collection and
    processing of information as described herein.
  </p>

  <h4>3. Information Collection Philosophy</h4>
  <p>
    Wellworth follows a principle of data minimization and purpose limitation.
    Information is collected only to the extent necessary to support legitimate
    business activities, operational requirements, statutory compliance, and
    contractual obligations. We do not collect personal data indiscriminately
    or beyond defined business purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Information may be collected directly from individuals through enquiry
    forms, email communications, phone calls, WhatsApp messages, meetings,
    contracts, and onboarding documentation, or indirectly through operational
    systems used for attendance, payroll, compliance, security, and reporting.
  </p>

  <h4>4. Categories of Information Processed</h4>
  <p>
    The Company may process personal identifiers such as names, phone numbers,
    email addresses, job titles, company affiliations, and communication records.
    In addition, operational data such as attendance logs, deployment schedules,
    verification documents, audit reports, incident records, and compliance
    documentation may be processed as part of Services delivery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technical information including IP addresses, browser types, device details,
    and access logs may also be collected automatically when users interact with
    our website. Such information is used strictly for security monitoring,
    analytics, troubleshooting, and performance optimization.
  </p>

  <h4>5. Use of Information</h4>
  <p>
    Information collected by Wellworth is used to respond to enquiries, evaluate
    Services requirements, prepare proposals, deliver contracted Services, manage
    operations, fulfill statutory obligations, conduct audits, ensure safety and
    security, and maintain ongoing communication with stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aggregated or anonymized data may be used for internal analysis, Services
    improvement, performance monitoring, and strategic planning. Personal data
    is never used for unauthorized advertising, resale, profiling, or
    commercial exploitation.
  </p>

  <h4>6. Workforce and Operational Data</h4>
  <p>
    As a Services provider managing manpower and security operations, Wellworth
    processes workforce-related information such as identity documents,
    background verification records, training certifications, attendance data,
    shift deployment details, and incident logs. Such processing is essential
    for compliance with labour laws, safety standards, and contractual
    obligations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Workforce data is handled with strict confidentiality and accessed only by
    authorized personnel involved in operations, compliance, supervision, and
    governance functions.
  </p>

  <h4>7. Legal Basis for Processing</h4>
  <p>
    All data processing activities are conducted in compliance with applicable
    Indian laws, including labour legislation, contractual requirements, and
    the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP), 2023. Processing is carried
    out based on consent, contractual necessity, legal obligation, or legitimate
    business interest, as applicable.
  </p>

  <h4>8. Confidentiality and Access Controls</h4>
  <p>
    Wellworth enforces strict confidentiality controls to ensure that personal
    and business information is accessed only by authorized employees, officers,
    auditors, and Services partners. Role-based access controls, internal policies,
    and confidentiality obligations are implemented across the organization.
  </p>

  <h4>9. Disclosure and Information Sharing</h4>
  <p>
    Information may be disclosed only where required by law, regulation, court
    order, audit requirement, or contractual obligation. This may include
    disclosures to government authorities, statutory bodies, auditors, legal
    advisors, or compliance consultants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wellworth does not sell, rent, lease, or trade personal information to third
    parties for marketing or commercial gain under any circumstances.
  </p>

  <h4>10. Data Security and Protection Measures</h4>
  <p>
    The Company adopts appropriate physical, technical, and administrative
    safeguards to protect information against unauthorized access, loss,
    alteration, or disclosure. These safeguards include secure document storage,
    access restrictions, internal controls, employee awareness, and periodic
    security reviews.
  </p>

  <h4>11. Data Retention and Disposal</h4>
  <p>
    Information is retained only for the duration necessary to fulfill business,
    legal, compliance, and contractual requirements. Upon expiry of the
    retention period, information is securely archived or disposed of in
    accordance with internal data retention and destruction policies.
  </p>

  <h4>12. Surveillance and Monitoring</h4>
  <p>
    Certain client locations may use CCTV surveillance, biometric systems,
    access control mechanisms, or electronic monitoring as part of security
    operations. Such monitoring is governed by applicable laws and client
    policies and is implemented solely for safety, security, and compliance.
  </p>

  <h4>13. Cookies and Website Analytics</h4>
  <p>
    Our website may use cookies and analytics tools to enhance functionality,
    monitor usage patterns, and improve user experience. Users may control or
    disable cookies through browser settings, subject to functionality
    limitations.

    Subject to applicable laws and contractual obligations, individuals may
    request access, correction, or deletion of their personal data. Requests
    will be evaluated and processed in accordance with legal requirements.
  </p>

  <h4>15. Policy Review and Updates</h4>
